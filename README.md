# Fake News Detection Web App

## Overview
This project is a machine learning-powered web application designed to detect fake news articles. The application uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text data and a logistic regression model to classify news as fake or real. The interactive web interface is built using Streamlit, allowing users to input news articles and receive real-time predictions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Implements tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal.
- **Feature Extraction**: Uses TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert text data into numerical features.
- **Model Training**: Trains a logistic regression model for binary classification of news articles.
- **Interactive Interface**: Provides a user-friendly web app for real-time fake news detection.
- **Real-time Predictions**: Offers immediate feedback on the authenticity of news articles.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Streamlit, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, NLTK
- **Machine Learning Model**: Logistic Regression
